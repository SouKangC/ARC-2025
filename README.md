# ARC-2025: Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my work on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge from Kaggle. ARC is designed to measure general AI capabilities through a set of tasks that require understanding core human cognitive abilities.

## Challenge Description
The ARC dataset consists of tasks where each task is presented as a set of example input-output pairs. The objective is to find the underlying pattern and apply it to a new input to generate the correct output. These tasks require understanding concepts such as:

- Object recognition and counting
- Spatial relationships
- Logical operations
- Pattern completion
- Analogy-making
- Geometric transformations

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the training and evaluation datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization
- `src/`: Source code for the solution
  - `models/`: Model implementations
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `visualizations/`: Code for visualizing ARC tasks
- `experiments/`: Experimental results and evaluations
- `submissions/`: Kaggle submission files

## Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ARC-2025.git
cd ARC-2025

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
# Run the baseline model
python src/run_baseline.py

# Generate a submission
python src/generate_submission.py
```

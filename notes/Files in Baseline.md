### 3.2 `arc_loader.py`
##### a) Overview
This code defines a comprehensive library for working with the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) dataset, providing utilities for data loading, manipulation, augmentation, and formatting for machine learning models. It implements these key features:
- **Data Augmentation**: Extensive options for task transformation to increase training data variety

### 3.3 `selection.py`
##### a) Overview
The code defines a collection of selection algorithms designed to choose optimal solutions from multiple model predictions for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) competition. This is a critical component in the submission pipeline, as it determines which predictions will be submitted as final answers.

At its core, the selection module offers several strategies for filtering and ranking candidate solutions based on different criteria. The simplest approach is `first_only`, which simply takes the first prediction, reflecting a high confidence in the model's initial guess. The `keep_order` algorithm preserves all predictions in their original sequence, useful when the ordering already reflects confidence levels. For eliminating redundancy, `keep_order_unique` builds on this by removing duplicate solutions.

The more sophisticated selection strategies leverage scoring mechanisms. `get_best_shape_by_score` groups predictions by their output shape (dimensions) and identifies the most promising shape based on a scoring function. This is particularly valuable in ARC problems where correct solutions often share consistent dimensions. The `score_sum` function extends this concept by accumulating scores for unique outputs while optionally preferring answers that match the most common output shape.

Two notable scoring implementations are provided: `score_all_probsum`, which converts log probabilities to probabilities and sums them to rank solutions, and `score_full_probmul_3`, which incorporates both inference scores and augmented scores with a baseline offset of 3. This combined approach aims to balance the model's direct confidence (inference scores) with additional evaluation metrics (augmented scores) for more robust selection.

The code includes utility functions like `hashable` and `make_unique` to handle the array-based outputs, ensuring proper comparison and deduplication. All these algorithms are collected in `selection_algorithms`, allowing for benchmarking different strategies against each other to determine the optimal approach for the final submission.

### 3.4 `async_tools.py`
##### a) Overview
This code provides a set of asynchronous utilities for executing and monitoring subprocesses in Python. Built on top of Python's `asyncio` library, these functions enable efficient parallel execution of external processes while capturing their output streams in real-time.

The `stream_reader` function serves as the core component, continuously reading from a subprocess's output stream (either stdout or stderr) in manageable chunks of 4KB. It implements a clever buffering mechanism to ensure complete lines are processed properly. By appending a sentinel character ('X') and using Python's unpacking syntax, it elegantly separates complete lines from partial data that might be cut off mid-line. Each complete line is optionally prefixed with an identifier and directed to the specified output stream.

The `wait_for_subprocess` function builds on this foundation by simultaneously monitoring both the stdout and stderr streams of a single subprocess. It uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently process both streams until completion, then waits for the subprocess to terminate and returns its exit code. The `print_output` parameter provides control over whether the subprocess output should be displayed, while the `id` parameter helps distinguish between outputs from different processes when multiple are running.

Finally, `wait_for_subprocesses` extends this capability to handle multiple subprocesses concurrently. It automatically assigns sequential numeric identifiers to each process when more than one is being monitored, making it easier to distinguish their outputs in a multiplexed console display.

This asynchronous approach is particularly valuable in data processing pipelines that might involve multiple external tools or long-running computations. Rather than blocking while waiting for each process to complete sequentially, these functions allow the Python program to efficiently manage multiple concurrent tasks, potentially improving overall throughput while maintaining organized output capture.
